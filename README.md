Hostel Management System
The Hostel Booking System is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to manage room bookings in a college hostel. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter details such as the student's name, room number, and booking date to book a room. The application validates inputs to ensure all fields are filled before adding the booking to an internal list. Users can view all existing bookings in a scrollable text area. The system employs an in-memory ArrayList to store booking details, making it lightweight and efficient for small-scale use. It also features simple error handling and displays appropriate messages for successful or invalid operations. This project is an excellent starting point for learning GUI programming and event handling with Java Swing.
